From Me to Myself
M. Hably Hukma Aula
Introduce, my name is Muhammad Hably Hukma Aula, quite long indeed, because it is a prayer climbing of my parents that is embedded in my name so that I am awarded the ultimate intelligence by God so that it becomes a commendable human being. From childhood I loved doing new things in my life both in choosing reading books and toys, maybe this is part of doing the future format.
Hopes and ideas are something that knows no bounds, every human being has the right to dream and have sky-high hopes. The birth of an idea arises because of a strong drive to become better and it can only be owned by a person who has an obsession with his future. According to Charles Hummel: "The past cannot be retrieved, although we can learn from it; while the future is something that we don't have, we must plan it from now on. " So, don't let us underestimate dreams, because dreams are the foundation that determines the future. The wise saying says "Today is a gift of God while tomorrow is a mystery". This advice underlines the importance of taking advantage of the opportunities we have to prepare for a future full of challenges.
Having ideals should be introduced from childhood so that they can inspire and motivate someone. So it is not surprising since we have often heard the question if we want to be big, what will it be? That question might have been asked since we were in kindergarten. When asked about the ideals of children will answer according to what he saw and considered great according to him. Popular professions often cited are teachers, doctors, soldiers, police, pilots, even as truck and bus drivers. It is indeed natural because in truth they do not yet understand the definition of what is ideal. As they get older, they slowly begin to understand what their future goals and goals are, and then they begin to think realistically to make them happen.
According to KBBI1, ideals are desires (wills) that are always in the mind. Each person will certainly have different opinions in interpreting an idea. I interpret the ideal is a goal that needs to be sought in being realized. The definition of ideals is a dream that can ignite the spirit, for a life that can move forward more, more quality, and more speed. But for those who consider their ideals only as a dream during the day, then like a fireplace that runs out of firewood, nothing drives it to become bigger, there is no business he wants to do, there is only always thinking pessimistically, that later the fire will also run out.
Even so to realize these ideals is also not as easy as turning the palm. Pursuing ideas such as making a climb, many obstacles that must be passed, and require energy that is strong enough. Many people assume that ideals are difficult to realize, but in my opinion, it is not entirely true, all ideals can be achieved if someone wants to try to make it happen, but do not forget also to pray and submit everything to the almighty. Albert Einstein said, "Science without religion is blind, whereas religion without science is lame". Another important thing is the focus. I interpreted the word focus is an abbreviation of Follow One Course Until Success. With our focus on one area, we will get much better quality.
Then what is my dream?
As the first paragraph above my name is M. Hably Hukma Aula, I am a santri2 who likes innovation. My interest in technology has grown from an early age, I loved to assemble radio, and with technology, I can express something before I say it. I always dreamed of being able to get a profession related to technology. I would grow up later so that I could get a profession while enjoying a hobby. As with other children, I often change my goals, sometimes I want to be a doctor, a pilot, to an army. But after growing up I finally knew the ideals and goals of life in the future, which then I began to think realistically to make it happen.
Now I sit on the bench MA3, although still in first grade, I tried hard to realize my dream. My first dream before graduating MA was that I had successfully finished my Quran memorization. Then my second dream after graduating MA was to study at the Bandung Institute of Technology, one of the reasons I wanted to study there was because I wanted to prove, that a santri can also excel in the public field, not only in the religious field. At the Bandung Institute of Technology, I want to major in informatics engineering. When I graduated from the Bandung Institute of Technology I wanted to go to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge-USA. There I want to develop my knowledge, even though I don't know what course I want to major in, for sure I want to learn lessons that don't yet exist in Indonesia so that I can start teaching that knowledge in Indonesia to realize one of my dreams first.
After getting my degree I wanted to become an engineer, I wanted to create a hologram that could later be used by commercial communities because that way could facilitate teaching and learning activities. Besides that, I want to become a forensic as my side job. Because I'm sure cybercriminals will continue to develop in the era of globalization like now. When I go to work later, I want to be able to get the chance to work with agencies abroad. Around the world, while working with a job that I like, has been my dream long ago. I want my first salary, I dedicate it to my parents who have introduced me to the world of this computer and always support me tirelessly, always praying, and always advising since I was a child. Having my salary and being able to buy things with my business without burdening my parents is also one of my dreams. My next dream is to continue my studies in Germany because I am sure there are many intelligent people there and there I want to be able to develop my knowledge and improve and improve my creative tools.
When I am satisfied with my work, I want to become a preacher who can protect his students and their community. When I become a parent, of course, I will introduce them to technology, I also want them to understand what technology means and how important technology is in this world.
